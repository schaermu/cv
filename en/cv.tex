	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
	Ever since I meticulously typed the first BASIC scripts from the AMIGA magazine into my Amiga 600 in the 90s, I have been fascinated by software development and all its facets. The statement “Just turn your hobby into a profession” from the owner of a graphics studio was the catalyst for a multi-faceted career in information technology, which I am still as passionate about over 20 years later as I was on the first day.\\

	{As a Requirements-to-Deployment Manager, I am responsible for the technical leadership for 13 teams in the domain of software development and support them in all aspects related to software engineering as a coach and mentor. This can cover a wide range of areas, such as requirements engineering, ways of working, methodology, standard tools \& developer experience or CI/CD \& automation. Where necessary, I also assist teams with implementation, for example when migrating to new CI/CD platforms, adopting new process models or when planning \& budgeting technological lifecycles.\\ \\
		In close cooperation with my management team, I also drive the strategic development of the department. This includes establishing various tools for strategy implementation such as OKR, flight levels, portfolio management and reporting dashboards.\\ \\
